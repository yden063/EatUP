# EatUP Android Application

Today we have a lot of meet applications. Some are based on appearance, other on personal interests, hobbies etc. But any of them at this time are based on the only thing you need to survive : eat.
This project aims to build an application to make people meet around food. 
Current solution

As an event creator, you can propose an eat meetup : 
* Create an event
* Choose the place to eat (the meet)
* Configure the meetup parameters : 
  * a. Time slot (ex: from 12am to 2pm) AND
  * b. Max participants AND
* Share the eat event !

As an event consumer, you can choose to participate to a meetup (eatUP?)
* Search for an event by :
  * a. Place to eat (ex: fast food PFK in downtown Montreal) AND/OR
  * b. Everything (user can see who will be around him
* Access the chosen event’s details
* Participate to the eat event !
* After the meet, you rate on 5 stars :
  * a. the event  (in general)
  * b. the people who participated
